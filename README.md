# Procedural Map Creator in Unity using Perlin Noise

This project is focus on the creation of maps dynamically with the use of the Perlin Noise algorithm, it will explore and study its complexity step by step with the use of C++ and Unity (version 2021.3.10f1).

##Perlin Noise

Perlin Noise is a random number generator algorithm with a twist, Unlike other randomizers Perlin generates numbers closer to each other resulting on smoother graphs. This can be helpful on different enviroments such as map creators, which can use the calculated values to establish mountain, valleys, etc. more naturally with less steep slopes.

Now a days games like Mincraft use similar algorithms to create not only the terrain but the different biomes.
